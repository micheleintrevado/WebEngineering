# Java_WebApp_Base_T9
> Base project for a Java web application deployed on Tomcat 9

This is the skeleton of a Java web application (with a sample servlet) running on JEE 8 and Tomcat 9

## Usage

This is a *sample application* developed during the lectures of the  [**Web Engineering course**](https://webengineering-univaq.github.io). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 7th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation

This is a Maven-based project. Simply download the code and open it in any Maven-enabled IDE such as Netbeans or Eclipse. Additionally, you may need to *configure the deploy settings*: the application is intended to be run on the **JavaEE 7** platform inside **Apache Tomcat version 9**. Refer to your IDE help files to perform this step. For example, in Apache Netbeans, you must enter these settings in Project properties > Run.
